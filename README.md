Telecom Industry Churn Analysis and Predictive Modeling

Dataset: Telecom Industry Churn Dataset

For Telecom companies it is key to attract new customers and at the same time avoid contract terminations (=churn) to grow their revenue generating base. Looking at churn, different reasons trigger customers to terminate their contracts, for example better price offers, more interesting packages, bad service experiences or change of customersâ€™ personal situations.  Churn analytics provides valuable capabilities to predict customer churn and also define the underlying reasons that drive it.
